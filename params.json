This is the current website for the progress on Gridiron Glory, a Python-based football management simulator. Check out the GitHub page [here](https://github.com/quetzle/gridironglory). Feel free to download and mess around with the demos!\r\n### About\r\nGridiron Glory strives to be a simple management sim for American football. You won't play the games, but you will draft players, set your depth chart, sign players, and more. The game will not be a realistic sim, but it will follow the rules of football and how the sport works. I hope the game will end up being a charming, easy, and fun game to play!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
